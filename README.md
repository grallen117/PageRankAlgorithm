# PageRankAlgorithm
This program uses hashing to create a Page Rank algorithm. This was completed in school, and a text file with a few million words and urls was provided. Essentially, you enter a word or url, and it will provide a list of words or urls related to that word/url, which are ranked based on frequency (generated using the initializeWeight function).
